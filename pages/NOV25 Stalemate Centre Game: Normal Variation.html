                <h2>Game Analysis</h2>

                <h3>Opening</h3>
                <p>
                    The opening got sharp straight away after I took on d4 with the queen. Bringing the queen out early
                    wasn't the best idea, because Black gained tempo with their pieces. The Bxf7+ check was mainly a
                    chance
                    to pull the king out and make things messy, but I didn't really have a follow-up planned. After the
                    queens came off, the position became calmer, but I could've developed more normally instead of
                    jumping
                    into tactics so early.
                </p>

                <h3>Middlegame</h3>
                <p>
                    The middlegame turned into a scramble, with both of us making threats and trying to stay active. I
                    liked
                    getting my bishops and rooks into the game, but a few moves were played without a clear plan. When I
                    got
                    moves like Ra7 and Rxg6, it felt like I had real chances, but I wasn't sure how to turn it into
                    something solid. Black kept fighting back with counterplay, so the game swung around and stayed
                    fairly
                    balanced.
                </p>

                <h3>Endgame</h3>
                <p>
                    The endgame became a pawn race, with my b-pawn pushing hard up the board. I had some pressure, but
                    Black's rook stayed active and made it hard to coordinate anything. With both kings open and no
                    clean
                    way forward for either side, the draw made sense in the end.
